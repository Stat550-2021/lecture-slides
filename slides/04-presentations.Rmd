# Strategy

---

## Genre

Talks take many forms (like papers)

* Department seminar

* Short conference presentation

* Class lecture

* `...`

Calibrate your talk to the .secondary[Genre] and the .secondary[Audience]

--

* A job talk takes much more work than a class presentation

* General ideas are the same

---

## Audience

* Think about who you are talking to
    - Statisticians?
    - Students?
    - Potential employer?
    - People with PhD's but in other disciplines?
    - Your grandma?
    
* Regardless of the audience, I think of dividing the talk roughly in 3rds.

--

1. Talk to your grandma. Why are you listening to me? Why is what I'm saying interesting?

2. Talk to your audience. What have I done that you should be able to do at the end?

3. Talk **slightly** over your audience. Why should you be impressed by me?

--

Part 3 is shorter depending on the Audience.


---

## Content 

Each part is a little mini-talk


1. Starts with the general idea

2. Develops a few details. .secondary[Strategy:] problem/solution or question/answer

3. Ends with a takeaway

--

But these parts are **recalibrated** to the audience.

* Your Grandma doesn't want to see math.
* Your employer might, but doesn't want to hear about $\sigma$-fields. 
* Statisticians don't want to see proofs (but might want a sketch).
* `...`

# Dos and don'ts

## Words

.pull-left[
Too many words on a slide is bad

* Bullet points
* Too densely concentrated are bad
* Are bad
* Are hard to focus on

<br><br>

Empty space is your friend

# Images

.pull-left[
Pictures are good

<br>

Flow charts are good.

<br>

.primary[Careful] use of .secondary[colour] is **good**.

<br>

### Size is good.

# Personal preferences



---

## Graphics

```{r colours1, echo=FALSE, dev="png", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut,price, fill=color)) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme_grey() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = scales::hue_pal()(n_distinct(diamonds$color)))
```

--

Defaults are almost always terrible.

---

## Issues with the preceding

* Colours are awful

* Grey background is distracting

* Text size is too small

* Legend position on the side is strange?

* Numbers on the y-axis are nonesense

* With barchart, y-axis should start at 0.

---

## Graphics

```{r colours2, echo=FALSE, dev="png", fig.width=16, fig.height=8, fig.align='center'}
g <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut,price, fill=color)) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw(24) + 
  ylab("price (USD)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si(),
                     expand = expansion(c(0,.05)))
g + scale_fill_viridis_d(guide = guide_legend(nrow=1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.key.width = unit(2, "cm"))
```

---

## Again

```{r colours3, echo=FALSE, dev="png", fig.width=16, fig.height=7, fig.align='center'}
g + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(2, "cm"),
        legend.key.height = unit(2, "cm"))
```

* I like this, but ~10% of men are colour blind (including some Stat faculty). 

---

## Simulation

![](gfx/colour-blind.png)

---

## Jargon

* Be wary of acronyms (MLE, BLUP, RKHS)

* Again, think of your audience. MLE is fine for any statistician.

* Others need definitions in words and written on the slide

* Same for math notation $\overline{x},\ \mu,\ \sigma,\ \mathbf{UDV}^\top$

* And for applied work e.g. SNP

## Things I hate

`r con` Saying "I'm not going to talk about ..."  `r pro` "I'm happy to discuss ... later if you'd like".

`r con` Wiggling your laser pointer at every word. Highlight important things with pretty colours. Use pointer sparingly.

`r con` Playing with your collar, your pockets, your water bottle...

`r con` Staring at your slides ...

`r con` Displaying the total number of slides as in 6/85 in the lower right hand corner ...

`r con` Running over time. Skipping 6 slides to desperately make the time limit.

`r con` Using the default themes:

---

background-position: center
background-size: contain

---

## Never use tables of numbers

* Economists do this all the time for inexplicable reasons

* I rarely put these in papers either

* If I'm not going to talk about it, it doesn't go on the slide

* There's no way I'm going to read off the number, certainly not to 4 decimal places

* Use a graph

## Things you should do

`r pro` Number your slides

`r pro` Have lots of prepared backup slides (details, answers to potential questions, further analysis)

`r pro` Practice a lot. Practice in front of others. Practice the beginning more than the rest.

`r pro` BE EXCITED. You worked hard on this. All results are cool. Play them up. You did something good and you want to tell everyone about how awesome you are. Own it. 

`r pro` Take credit. Say "I showed this" not "It can be shown".
