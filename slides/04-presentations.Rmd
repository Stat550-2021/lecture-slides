## Structure

1. Dos and don'ts

1. Personal preferences

class: middle, center, inverse

# Strategy

---

## Genre

Talks take many forms (like papers)

* Department seminar

* Short conference presentation

* Class lecture

* `...`

Calibrate your talk to the .secondary[Genre] and the .secondary[Audience]

--

* A job talk takes much more work than a class presentation

* General ideas are the same

---

## Audience

* Think about who you are talking to
    - Statisticians?
    - Students?
    - Potential employer?
    - People with PhD's but in other disciplines?
    - Your grandma?
    
* Regardless of the audience, I think of dividing the talk roughly in 3rds.

--

1. Talk to your grandma. Why are you listening to me? Why is what I'm saying interesting?

2. Talk to your audience. What have I done that you should be able to do at the end?

3. Talk **slightly** over your audience. Why should you be impressed by me?

--

Part 3 is shorter depending on the Audience.


---

## Content 

Each part is a little mini-talk


1. Starts with the general idea

2. Develops a few details (problem/solution, or question/answer)

3. Ends with a takeaway

--

But these parts are **recalibrated** to the audience.

* Your Grandma doesn't want to see math.
* Your employer might, but doesn't want to hear about $\sigma$-fields. 
* Statisticians don't want to see proofs (but might want a sketch).
* `...`

# Dos and don'ts

## Words

.pull-left[
Too many words on a slide is bad

* Bullet points
* Too densely concentrated are bad
* Are bad
* Are hard to focus on

Empty space is your friend
